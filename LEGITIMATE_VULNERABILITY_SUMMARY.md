## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Verification Required**: All findings require manual verification and testing.  
⚠️ **False Positives**: Some findings may be false positives or may not be exploitable.  
⚠️ **Responsible Disclosure**: Any confirmed vulnerabilities should be reported responsibly to package maintainers.  
⚠️ **No CVE Claims**: This analysis does not assign CVE numbers or make definitive vulnerability claims.

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Verification**: Each finding should be manually reviewed and tested
2. **Context Analysis**: Consider the specific usage context of each pattern
3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report confirmed issues to maintainers
4. **Documentation**: Document verification results and remediation steps
