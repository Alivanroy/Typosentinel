# Typosquatting Detection

TypoSentinel flags packages with names similar to popular libraries that may be deceptive.

## What to Check
- Publisher reputation and package history
- Download counts, release cadence, and community references
- README and code quality vs the legitimate package

## Actions
- Replace with the official package
- Add safeguards (lockfiles, strict version ranges)
- Monitor for similar names in dependency updates
