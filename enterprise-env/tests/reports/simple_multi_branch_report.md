## Test Categories

### 🌿 Branch Security Scanning
Validates security scanning across different Git branches (main, develop, feature, release).

### 🔄 Branch Comparison
Compares security posture between different branches to identify new risks.

### 🔀 Merge Simulation
Simulates merge operations and validates security impact of combining branches.

### 🚀 Release Validation
Ensures release branches meet security standards before deployment.

```

## Branch Security Recommendations

### Development Workflow
- **Main Branch:** Maintain strict security policies with zero tolerance for critical/high threats
- **Develop Branch:** Allow medium threats but require review for high/critical
- **Feature Branches:** Scan early and often, block merges with unresolved threats
- **Release Branches:** Enforce comprehensive security validation before deployment

### Security Gate Configuration
- **Pre-commit:** Basic vulnerability scanning
- **Pre-merge:** Comprehensive threat analysis
- **Pre-release:** Full security audit with manual review

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up automated notifications for new threats in any branch
- Implement security dashboards for branch comparison
- Configure alerts for policy violations

## Key Findings

- **Branch Coverage:** All major branch types tested successfully
- **Threat Detection:** Multi-branch scanning identifies branch-specific risks
- **Merge Safety:** Simulation testing prevents security regressions
- **Release Readiness:** Automated validation ensures secure deployments
