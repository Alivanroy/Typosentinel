MANUAL CHANGES NEEDED IN main.go:

1. Remove these command flags from edge commands:
   - --qubits
   - --neural-layers
   - --quantum-threshold
   - --adaptive-learning

2. Simplify edge command descriptions:
   BEFORE: "GTR (Graph-based Threat Recognition) uses advanced graph theory and network analysis"
   AFTER: "GTR (Graph Traversal Reconnaissance) analyzes package dependency relationships"

3. Remove any references to:
   - Quantum computing
   - Neural networks (in command descriptions)
   - Adaptive learning
   - Deep learning

4. Keep these core edge commands:
   - gtr (Graph Traversal Reconnaissance)
   - runt (Recursive Universal Network Traversal)
   - dirt (Dependency Impact Risk Traversal)
   - aicc (Adaptive Intelligence Correlation Clustering)
