## Attack Vector Analysis

### Typosquatting Attacks
Packages that mimic legitimate Python libraries through character substitution, addition, or deletion:
- **pandas2** (Risk: 0.97)
- **pandas3** (Risk: 0.97)
- **sckiit-learn** (Risk: 0.0)
- **f1ask** (Risk: 0.0)
- **tensorflows** (Risk: 0.0)
- **scarpy** (Risk: 0.0)
- **ebautifulsoup4** (Risk: 0.0)
- **b3autifulsoup4** (Risk: 0.0)
- **flasks** (Risk: 0.0)

### Dependency Confusion
Packages that exploit version confusion or fake library names:
- **pymongo2** (Risk: 0.0, Type: version_confusion)
- **pytest-lib** (Risk: 0.0, Type: fake_library)
- **requests-lib** (Risk: 0.0, Type: fake_library)
- **pillow2** (Risk: 0.0, Type: version_confusion)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block all packages identified with critical malware
   - Review and validate any dependencies on high-risk packages
   - Implement package verification in CI/CD pipelines

2. **Long-term Security**:
   - Use dependency pinning with hash verification
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Monitor for typosquatting variants of critical dependencies
   - Use private package repositories for internal packages

3. **Detection Improvements**:
   - Enhance monitoring for packages with missing metadata
   - Implement real-time scanning of new package uploads
   - Create alerts for packages mimicking popular libraries
